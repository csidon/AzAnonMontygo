There really was a Cumberland Farms. Vasilios and Aphrodite Haseotes bought it in Cumberland, Rhode Island in 1939, along with their very first cow.

In 1962, Cumberland Farms opened up the first ever convenience store in the Northeast.

Way back in 1972, we were one of the first places anywhere to offer self-serve gasoline. Today, Cumberland Farms has almost 600 stores in 11 states, and employs over 6,000 people.

In 1986, Cumberland Farms bought all of Gulf Oil's gas stations and trademark in the Northeast.

We sell nearly 3 million gallons of Chill Zone every year, or enough to fill 6 olympic size pools.

Long before Ari Haseotes became President of Cumberland Farms, he was a manager in our Westborough MA store.

Last year, The Cumberland Gulf Group of companies ranked in the Top 50 of the Forbes Top 500 Private Companies.

The most popular Chill Zone flavor today is Berry Backlash, followed by NRG Kick and Red Rage.

45,"Cain and Abel they're not! Brothers and executives Joe and Mike Zeiden founded Z Gallerie in 1979, using their parents' garage for a warehouse and production facility. Initially Z Gallerie (later joined by sister Carole Malfatti) sold poster art, but in the 1980s the trio added home furnishings and accessories to the merchandising mix. Today Z Gallerie stores, which span some 10,000 sq. ft. on average, feature bedding and pillows, dinnerware, glassware, rugs, lamps, candleholders, clocks, frames and albums, games, and gifts. The firm's eclectic pieces are sold through its website and some 55 US retail locations in nearly 20 states. Z Gallerie exited Chapter 11 in fall 2009 after a six-month stint in bankruptcy.

Since emerging from bankruptcy protection, Z Gallerie spends its time prudently shopping for new locations for its shops while the company keeps a close eye on the performance of its existing stores. The furniture retailer opened a store in Redmond, Washington, and in late 2011 opened two more shops: one each in Texas and Georgia.

Prior to its April 2009 bankruptcy filing, the furniture seller shuttered about 20 underperforming stores and a distribution center in Atlanta in response to the slowdown in the economy. The closures caused the firm to exit several markets, including Ohio, consolidate its network of distributors, and shed about 350 employees.

Z Gallerie blamed its financial woes on the recession and competition from going-out-of-business sales held by competitors as the recession took root. The company said that it filed for Chapter 11 to strengthen its balance sheet and to get out of the lease obligations associated with the closed stores and distribution facility. '“ less"

84,"GameStop holds the top score in video game retailing. Operating under the GameStop, EB Games, and Micromania banners, it's the largest retailer of new and used games, hardware, entertainment software, and accessories. It boasts nearly 6,700 stores in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada. By carrying about 4,500 items, including more than 3,000 used video game titles, a majority of GameStop's revenue is generated by sales of new and used video games and their software. The company also sells downloadable add-on content from publishers. GameStop operates several e-commerce websites, offers GameStop TV in many of its locations, and publishes Game Informer, a video game magazine with some 7.2 million subscribers.

Strategy

Despite the gloomy selling forecast for retailers during the past few years, GameStop has logged its greatest revenue increases during the recession and beyond. It's seeing the largest gains among used video game products as the company lures more frugal customers who want to stay in the game even with tighter budgets. For used items, revenue rose from 23% of 2009 revenue to 28% in 2012. More consumers are turning to existing video game products, rather than new, due to their availability and cost-effectiveness. That bodes well for GameStop, because used game products (with their higher gross margins) is the company's most profitable segment. To maintain its foothold in new and used gaming, GameStop continues to target hardcore gamers as well as those niche customers who purchase games as gifts during the holidays. 

Financial Analysis

Those gamers who jockey for the latest and greatest video game software still chose to shop at GameStop, which brought in another 42% of its 2012 revenue from new video game software. GameStop saw slight sales declines, however, among its lower-margin new video game hardware product segment (21% in 2009 to 17% in 2012). The company points to lower consumer demand and price cuts on hardware consoles for the sales slips. The sales decline on new hardware wasn't detrimental to GameStop, though, as the products generate a high single-digit profit margin for the games chain. 

Geographic Reach

GameStop operates its stores in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada.

Operations

GameStop has continued to expand its operations in the US and overseas, but most of its recent sales growth has come from outside the US. In Europe the company has logged revenue increases that have offset sales declines in the US related to decreased demand. Boosting its store count overseas has allowed GameStop to maintain its overall store growth strategy. While expansion from 2011 to 2012 slowed to a mere net 13 stores, the company has reached its current store count through several years of aggressive growth. In 2010 alone GameStop added more than 220 stores to its operations across the board (107 in the US, 88 in Europe, 17 in Australia, and eight in Canada). Albeit, this is modest growth for GameStop, which opened 674 new stores in 2008, 586 stores during 2007, and 421 stores in 2006. (To the uninitiated, GameStop was a much smaller game in town just seven years ago. The company's purchase of rival Electronics Boutique in 2005 doubled GameStop's size.)

Mergers & Acquisitions

GameStop is also looking to the Web's game space for growth. In 2011 the company acquired Spawn Labs, which develops peer-to-peer game streaming technology, so that gamers can access their video games and play with others (via an Internet-connected device) even when they are away from home. Spawn Labs sells its streaming applications to game developers. The business is being integrated into GameStop's research and development unit, as Spawn Labs' expertise in virtualization is key to strengthening the retailer's online gaming offerings. Also in 2011 GameStop acquired the Impulse subsidiary of software company Stardock Systems, whose online distribution platform enables gamers to purchase and download games to their computers. Impulse offers more than 1,100 games, a number that is sure to grow with Spawn Labs on board. Prior to these deals, GameStop secured a digital platform in 2010 when it acquired Kongregate, a gaming site launched in 2007 for social gaming that attracts some 10 million users a month. As part of the purchase, Kongregate operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of GameStop and maintains its headquarters in San Francisco.

Sales & Marketing

The company considers itself a destination location for gamers. It develops relationships with video game enthusiasts through its PowerUp Rewards loyalty program (launched in 2010) by allowing consumers to trade in used video games for store credits on future purchases. '“ less"

86,"DespaÃ±a Brand Foods was established in 1971 as the first manufacturer of Spanish style chorizos based in New York serving the wholesale sectors, primarily throughout the Tri-State region. The company's original focus in the specialty food division stemmed from their USDA Inspected manufacturing facility, and in the late 80's began gradually incorporating a wide line of imported specialty foods to service their restaurant and gourmet retail market accounts. Taking a wide leap forward, today DespaÃ±a Brand Foods continues to be a family run operation that has earned a very strong presence as a recognized leading importer of authentic, high quality, brand name food products exclusively from Spain.

As the NY ambassadors of the Spanish food culture, the products they import help to influence and elevate gastronomy and food culture here in the US, blending traditional, old world ingredients with new world, avant garde flavors and cuisine. DespaÃ±a Brand Foods extends through their network of select distributors located in strategic regions of the USA, such as Florida, Maryland, Chicago, Seattle, Las Vegas, and Puerto Rico to name a few. Their large customer base is composed of respected chefs, restaurant operating groups, hotels, think tanks directors, food boutiques, gourmet stores, and culinary teaching institutions.

The company's arms of influence expanded in 2006 touching the retail gourmand consumer by opening the first, and still currently the only, NYC specialty food boutique offering authentic products from Spain. In 2011, their reach continued with DespaÃ±a Vinos y Mas, a sister boutique specializing in Spanish wines and liquors. The store operates conveniently next to their flagship food boutique and cafÃ© in the fashionable neighborhood of Soho, NYC. In Summer of 2012, DespaÃ±a Princeton was launched in Princeton NJ, as their first joint venture partnership located outside of NY.

Their chorizo factory and original small retail store front remains located in Jackson Heights, Queens, with the corporate headquarters and warehouse facility for distribution located in Woodside, Queens.

The company mission is of a continued commitment and responsibility to bringing quality, authentic Spanish foods and products to the U.S, with a dedication to educating their customers. Their aim is to maintain a cultural bridge 'œfrom Spain' (DespaÃ±a) to New York, providing and using great ingredients, paired with excellent wines and spirits all presented among the universal experience of social cheer and enjoyment of food.
